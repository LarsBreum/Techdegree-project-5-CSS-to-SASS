# Techdegree-project-5-CSS-to-SASS
In this project I had to convert the: responsive design project to a SASS project. The goal was to make the code as DRY and readable as possible, while still maintaining the exact same functionality and feel.

In this project I used all the awesome features og SASS, such as nesting, mixins, functions, extensions and everything else.
